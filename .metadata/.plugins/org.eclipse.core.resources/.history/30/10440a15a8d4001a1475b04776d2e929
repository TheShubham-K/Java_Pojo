//	1) imagine you write a code for a class, and another dozen programmers from your company all write programs that used your class. 
//	Now imagine that later on you dint like the way the class behaved, because some of its instance variables were being set to values you hadn't anticipated. 
//	Their code brought out errors in your code.
//	So how you will write a program to replace variables in their program without changing any of their own code?
